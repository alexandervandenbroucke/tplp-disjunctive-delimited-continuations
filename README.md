# Disjunctive Delimited Continuations

The Prolog sources accompanying the TPLP version of the Disjunctive Delimited Continuations paper.

* `meta.pl` contains the meta interpreter
* `examples.pl` contains most of the examples contained in the paper, except for the Probabilistic Programming examples
* `engines.pl` contains a simulation of Tarau's engines implemented with disjunctive delimited continuations
* `probabilistic.pl` implements PRISM- and ProbLog-style logic probabilistic programming

# TODO
* Add a link to this repository in the paper
* Discuss if the meta interpreter should support if-then-else constructs
* Add examples for `engines.pl`
